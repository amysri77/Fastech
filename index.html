              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES</strong><br><br>The ICS conducted a total of twelve events in August and September 2023: two Book Discussions, two Special Events, and eight Wednesday Seminars.</p>
              <h6 style="text-align: left;"><b>August</b></h6><br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">On 2 August 2023, the Institute conducted a seminar on <b>China’s Strategies to Sustain Its Monopoly on Critical Minerals.</b>China’s Strategies to Sustain Its Monopoly on Critical Minerals. The speaker was <strong>Ms. Neha Mishra,</strong> Associate Fellow, Indo- Pacific Group, Centre for Air Power Studies (CAPS), New Delhi. The speaker posited that China has employed critical minerals as geopolitical leverage on multiple occasions. She cited the example of China’s export restrictions on Gallium and Germanium, among other such elements to resource-deficient Japan. Ms. Mishra asserted that China’s strategies to secure its monopoly on these resources are diverse, ranging from investments in key global mines, especially in Africa, to building interdependence among source countries and manufacturing hubs in China, and engaging with emerging players like Myanmar, which possess vast expanses of unexploited resources. The seminar was chaired by <strong>Mr. Ravi Bhoothalingam,</strong> Honorary Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi. The Chair noted that China’s strategic employment of critical minerals in its policies has had a significant impact on its relations with other nations, and has contributed to the pursuit of seeking alternatives within the global supply chain apparatus.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVtPW4pt3Js" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">The second seminar was conducted on 9 August 2023 titled <b>Decoding Korea’s Indo-Pacific Strategy.</b>The speaker was <strong>Mr. Sang-Woo</strong> Lim, Deputy Chief of Mission, Embassy of the Republic of Korea, New Delhi. According to the speaker, at the core of Korea's Indo-Pacific strategy lie three fundamental pillars: freedom, peace, and prosperity. Further, Korea promotes three principles of cooperation namely, inclusivity, trust, and reciprocity in its relations with other nations. Korea's strategy is not aimed against any specific nation, especially China, but embodies the aspiration of assuming a more substantial role in the region. Mr Lim explained how Korea is supporting its neighbouring countries’ efforts toward realising their aspirations of achieving national development and economic growth. He elaborated on various programmes and initiatives undertaken by the Republic of Korea in the pursuit of this objective. He also focused on the close ties between India and Korea and argued that their shared vision is instrumental in ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. The session was chaired by <strong>Dr. Jitendra Uttam,</strong> Associate Professor, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, who posited that Korea’s geopolitical importance has necessitated a comprehensive reorientation along policy lines. Korea’s Indo-Pacific strategy also reflects its growing dilemmas about balancing between the United States, on which Korea depends on for security, and China, on which Korea is economically reliant.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pyxCbhe60" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">The third seminar was held on 16 August 2023 on <b>Japan’s Energy and Climate Change Policy Challenges Since 2011: An Assessment.</b> The speaker was <strong>Dr. Peter J. Hudson,</strong> Researcher, Institute of Global International Relations, Tokyo. Dr. Hudson’s presentation reviewed the rapid changes in Japan’s energy and climate change policies in the past decade, in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear power-plant accident in March 2011. It also focused on Japan's decision to “restart and rebuild” its reactor fleet, the factors which necessitated these changes and the challenges ahead in keeping up with climate and sustainability commitments, both domestically and internationally. The seminar was chaired by <strong>Dr. Shamshad Ahmad Khan,</strong> Assistant Professor, International Relations, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, BITS Pilani Dubai Campus, UAE. Dr. Khan pointed out that although Japan intends to diversify its energy sources, the reliance on traditional sources remains dominant. Much ground needs to be covered with regard to Japan’s climate change policy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQb6gmqD1YY" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">The Wednesday Seminar conducted on 23 August 2023, was titled <b>Political Echo Chambers and Misinformation in Digital China.</b> The speaker was <strong>Dr. Tilak Jha,</strong> Associate Professor of Journalism,  Times  School  of  Media,  Bennett  University,  Greater  Noida,  Delhi-NCR.  Dr.  Jha expounded on how active state intervention in the social, political, cultural, and economic digital spaces is intensifying concerns, domestically and internationally, about the credibility of nearly all available information in China. Jha opined that being politically correct is not an expectation but a mandate in China. The CPC has also expanded its ability to track digital information. Under Xi Jinping, it has ensured control through stringent laws and censorship, especially on social media, as well as through the effective employment of propaganda. He also discussed the vulnerability of digital information to heightened state control due to restricted institutional scope and limited mechanisms to course correct. The seminar was chaired  by  <strong>Dr.  Usha  Chandran,</strong>  Assistant  Professor,  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University,  New  Delhi; and, Honorary Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi. Dr. Chandran highlighted the relevance of information, and how controlling its spread is linked with the CPC’s legitimacy. She also noted that the Chinese citizens are exploring new and innovative ways to voice their opinions, which are often critical of the CPC, to circumvent the restrictions on the spread of information in China. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9gmgwbFtpU" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">The ICS conducted a book discussion on <b>World Upside Down: India  Recalibrates  its Geopolitics,</b> authored by <strong>Ambassador Sujan R. Chinoy,</strong> Director General, Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA), New Delhi, on 25 August 2023. According to Amb. Chinoy, the book focused on how India is dealing with a variety of regional and international challenges as it carves a new trajectory for itself in a tumultuous world that increasingly, appears “untethered and upside down.” Amb. Chinoy argued that states are now adopting a “China plus” strategy, seeking alternatives to China, given its significant economic and demographic issues. He warned that China must recognise the  significance  of establishing normalised borders, or else India may distance itself further. Amb. Chinoy pointed out that the relationship between India and China has never been characterised by credibility and trust, despite India's adherence to legal and diplomatic processes. In his view, although intergovernmental cooperation remained a possibility, public sentiment towards China has regressed to the levels observed during the 1962 conflict. The discussion was chaired by <strong>Mr. Ashok K. Kantha,</strong> Honorary Fellow and former Director, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi; Distinguished Fellow, Vivekananda International Foundation, New Delhi. Drawing from years of experience in dealing with China, Mr. Kantha added that India needs to further develop its strategies towards China to contend with Chinese overtures in a more comprehensive manner.

              <p style="text-align: justify;"> The fifth seminar of the month was held on 30 August 2023, on the topic <b>Contours of the Youth Crisis in China Today.</b> The speakers for the seminar were <strong>Amb. Kishan S. Rana,</strong> former Indian Ambassador/ High Commissioner to Algeria, Czechoslovakia, Kenya, Mauritius and Germany; Professor Emeritus, DiploFoundation, Malta and Geneva; and, Emeritus Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi; and, <strong>Dr. Hemant Adlakha,</strong> Associate Professor, Centre for Chinese and South East Asian Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi and Vice-Chairperson, ICS. The speakers examined the different facets of the youth crisis in China, contextualising them within the ambit of the state of the economy, the rural-urban divide, and demographic and societal trends and also offered comparisons with trends pertaining to the youth in India.. Dr. Adlakha highlighted the fact that China's educated youth are increasingly compelled to accept low-wage jobs or enter the informal sector. Earlier, most of the urban unemployed youth only had high-school education, whereas today, over 70% possessed higher education degrees. Amb. Rana traced the origins of the present despondency among the Chinese youth regarding employment, back to the One-Child Policy, arguing that the crisis could be an unanticipated consequence of the same. Drawing a comparison between India and China, he noted that Indian youth are more proactive in seeking employment, even if it is low paying. The discussion was chaired by <strong>Prof. Sabaree Mitra,</strong> Chairperson and Professor, Centre for Chinese and South East Asian Studies, School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies,  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University,  New  Delhi;  and,  Honorary  Fellow,  Institute  of  Chinese Studies, New Delhi, who also underscored the seriousness of the challenge. Given the distinct systems and historical trajectories of China and India, she inquired as to which nation is better equipped to navigate the prevailing despondency within their respective youth populations, and what strategies they might employ to confront this crisis. Both speakers concurred on the need for further research on this subject. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcrEUveJnv8" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p> <br><br>

              <h6 style="text-align: left;">September</h6><br><br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">On 4 September 2023, the ICS organised a Special Lecture titled, <b>Who Is In, Who Is Out?: Urban Redevelopment, Local Identity, and Vernacular Proficiency in Shanghai. Dr. Fang Xu,</b> Continuing Lecturer, Interdisciplinary Studies Program, University of California, Berkeley, was the speaker for this lecture. The speaker explained how the Chinese urbanities internalize,   navigate the transformed urban geographical and socio-linguistic landscape and position themselves in it. Drawing on extensive fieldwork carried out in China, Dr Xu noted the mandated usage of Standard Mandarin. In this context, she highlighted the issues of identity, and popular responses in Shanghai. The lecture was chaired by <strong>Dr. Anand P. Krishnan,</strong> Fellow, Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR; and, Visiting Associate Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi. <a href="https://www.icsin.org/activity/show/wednesday-seminar-pla-plan-to-construct-a-railway-line-along-aksai-chin-road-linking-xinjiang-with-tibet-implications-for-indian-security-13-september-2023-3-pm-ist-zoom-webinar" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">On 13 September 2023, the ICS organised a seminar on <b>Plan to Construct a Railway Line Along Aksai-Chin Road Linking Xinjiang with Tibet: Implications for Indian Security.</b> The speaker was <strong>Col. Virendra Sahai Verma,</strong> Retd., Honorary Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi. The talk focused on the implications of the railway line construction and looked at India’s options to ramp up its security and safeguard its own interests. The suggestions as mentioned by the speaker included strengthening infrastructure along its northern borders, particularly in Ladakh, diversifying transportation routes to Ladakh, and enhancing airfield capabilities in the northern plains. Taking the broader geopolitical realities into context, the speaker also suggested strengthening diplomatic ties with other regional powers such as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Australia. The session was chaired by <strong>Mr. M V Rappai,</strong> Honorary Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi. Drawing from his experience in strategic analysis, Mr. Rappai added that India needs to streamline its strategy with respect to China, and further develop its approaches toward fostering better relations with neighbouring countries. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnBAwHLhu2k&t=5s" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a>
              </p><br><br>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">On 14 September 2023, the second Special Seminar on the topic <b>Interpreting China’s Strategy
                on the Northern Borders</b> was held. The speaker was <strong>Lt. Gen. Prakash Menon,</strong> Retd., Director,
                Strategic Studies Programme, and Professorial Fellow, Takshashila Institution, Bengaluru;
                Professor Emeritus, Trans Disciplinary University (TDU); and, Adjunct Professor, National Institute
                of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Bengaluru. The presentation sought to validate the hypothesis that
                China’s aggressive action along India’s Northern Borders is connected to its global
                confrontation with the US and its allies. The speaker argued that China is using the Northern
                Borders to create “pinch points” that can exert pressure on India’s military capabilities and
                divert India’s military and political energy, while keeping India confined to the sub-continent.
                Another objective of China’s strategy, according to the speaker, is to slow down India’s growth
                as a maritime power, by ensuring a constant military entanglement along the Northern
                Borders. The session was chaired by <strong>Amb. Vijay K. Nambiar,</strong> former Indian Ambassador;
                Deputy National Security Adviser of India; and, Honorary Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies,
                New Delhi. Amb. Nambiar noted that India’s focus should lie on maintaining preparedness
                when it comes to dealing with China. Effective diplomatic overtures coupled with a
                comprehensive strategy remain the need of the hour. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1RiWHmwACY" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The second Book Discussion took place on 15 September 2023, on <b>Locating BRICS in the Global
                  Order: Perspectives from the Global South.</b> The speakers for the session were four of the
                  editors of the volume: <strong>Dr. Rajan Kumar,</strong> Associate Professor, School of International Studies,
                  Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; <strong>Dr. Meenakshi Sundriyal,</strong> Assistant Professor, Centre for
                  Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Latin American Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New
                  Delhi; <strong>Prof. Meeta Keswani Mehra,</strong> Professor of Economics, Centre for International Trade and
                  Development, School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; and <strong>Dr. G.
                    Venkat Raman,</strong> Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Indore. Focussing on India's role in
                  the BRICS, the presentations explicated the possibilities of locating BRICS culturally. The
                  dominant socio-economic trends of the BRICS countries over the last few decades were also
                  discussed. The speakers provided a comprehensive background to BRICS as a leading
                  organisation in the Global South, which also provided glimpses into the process of putting this
                  diverse volume together. The ensuing question-and-answer session allowed attendees to
                  delve deeper into the book’s themes. Dr. Kumar addressed inquiries regarding India’s role in
                  BRICS and the competition for leadership in the global South, given China’s aspirations to
                  challenge the US as a global superpower. Prof. Mehra explored the balance between market-driven policy frameworks and geopolitical tensions between India and China, highlighting the
                  ongoing debate between a Western-led democratic, rules-based system and the emergence
                  of a unipolar world influenced by Chinese attributes and objectives. The discussion contributed
                  to scholarly insights into the BRICS dynamics and the evolving global world order. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3YS0tlMQy8&t=262s" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> On 20 September 2023, the Institute organised a panel discussion titled, <b>Deciphering the Global Development Initiative: China’s New Pathway for Global South?.</b> This seminar was the second of an ICS series on China’s three global initiatives. The first seminar, on the GlobalSecurity Initiative, was held on 28 June 2023. The speakers for this panel discussion were <strong>Ms.Samantha Custer,</strong> Director of Policy Analysis, AidData, Global Research Institute, College of William & Mary, Virginia; <strong>Ms. Anthea Mulakala,</strong> Senior Director for International Development Cooperation, The Asia Foundation; and, Ms. Linda Calabrese, Research Fellow, International Development Programme at Overseas Development Institute, London, and Leverhul me Doctoral Fellow, Lau China Institute, King’s College, London. Delving into the intricacies of the GDI, the speakers explored its goals, priority areas, and the discourse centered on relevant issues of sustainable development, as well as the expected outcomes. The panel also examined whether the GDI is an extension of the Belt and Road Initiative, or if it seeks to complement it. The session was chaired by <strong>Dr. Anand P. Krishnan,</strong> Fellow, Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR; and Visiting Associate Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi. It was noted that while projects under the BRI are more driven towards China-based economic and infrastructure development projects, the GDI is more inclined towards multilateral institutions like the UN, such that it augments China’s existing aims for the Global South. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjiXkdHEmsI&t=939s" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p><br><br>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">The seminar on 27 September 2023 was titled <b>The Romance of the Two Kingdoms: Sino- Russian Energy Relations</b> and was presented by <strong>Dr. Prachi Aggarwal,</strong> Assistant Professor, DEAS, University of Delhi. The seminar explored Sino-Russian energy relations, bringing the focus on the establishment of pipelines, the “oil-for-loan” schemes, and the opening-up of Eastern Siberia for Chinese investment. Dr. Aggarwal posited that energy falls within the ambit of China’s core national interests and its energy security concerns have opened new avenues for Sino-Russian partnership. Of note is the Russian government-backed Gazprom, with a focus on developing energy supply routes into North-East China. The speaker further noted that the geopolitical significance of this “romance” will have major ripple effects in international relations for a considerable period in the present and in the future. The session was chaired by <strong>Prof. Alka Acharya,</strong> Honorary Director, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi; and, Chairperson and Professor, Centre for East Asian Studies, School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cYJOuz4VC8&t=348s" target="_blank" style="color:brown;">(YouTube)</a></p>
